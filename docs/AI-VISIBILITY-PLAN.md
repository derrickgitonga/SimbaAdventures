# Simba Adventures - AI Visibility Acceleration Plan

## 🎯 Goal: Get Simba Adventures Cited in AI Search Results

This document outlines **immediate, short-term, and long-term** actions to improve visibility in Gemini, ChatGPT, and Perplexity.

---

## ⚠️ Important Reality Check

**Why you're not appearing yet:**

1. **Indexing Lag** - Even Google takes days/weeks to fully index new content
2. **Domain Authority** - Your `.vercel.app` subdomain has limited authority compared to established travel sites
3. **Backlink Profile** - AI models prioritize sites with many quality inbound links
4. **Training Data** - LLMs like Gemini have knowledge cutoffs; your site content isn't in their training data yet
5. **Competition** - Travel queries compete with TripAdvisor, Viator, Safari.com, etc.

**Realistic Timeline:**
- Google Indexing: 1-7 days
- Basic AI citations: 2-6 weeks  
- Consistent AI visibility: 3-6 months
